## 📦 Week 1: Anime Character Image Classifier 🎴

### 🧩 Objective

Build a computer vision model capable of identifying anime characters from images.

### 🛠️ Steps Overview

1. **Web Scraping**:  
   Create my own dataset of anime character images using a web scraper. This involves:
   - Identifying reliable sources (e.g., anime-character wikis, fan pages).

2. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Resize, normalize, and augment images.
   - Organize into labeled directories for supervised learning.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Train a CNN (e.g., using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Keras).
   - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Inference Pipeline**:
   - Build a simple script or interface to input an image and return predicted character.
