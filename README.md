# 🧠 Weekly Machine Learning Project Challenge

Welcome to the **Weekly Machine Learning Project Challenge**!  
This repository serves as a playground for weekly hands-on machine learning projects designed to strengthen practical ML skills through diverse challenges.

---

## 📅 Project Schedule

Each week introduces a new machine learning project focusing on different domains, datasets, and techniques.  
Projects will range from computer vision and natural language processing to tabular modeling and reinforcement learning.

## 📦 Week 1: Image Classifier 🎴

### 🧩 Objective

Build a computer vision model capable of identifying different images (i specifically used anime characters but you are free to use any kind of images).

### 🛠️ Steps Overview

1. **Web Scraping**:  
   Created my own dataset of anime character images using a web scraper from https://myanimelist.net/character.php website.

2. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Resize, normalize images.
   - Organize into labeled directories for supervised learning.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Train a CNN (using TensorFlow, Keras...).
   - Evaluate using accuracy.
